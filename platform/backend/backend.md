## .gitignore

Add the following lines to default Rails-generated `.gitignore` file:

```
.DS_Store
database.yml
secrets.yml
.idea
coverage/
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
```


## Best practices

### Databases

* Use ActiveRecord ORM (scopes, enums, where with conditions, order etc) instead of raw SQL queries 
* Design the database schema with [Vertabelo](http://www.vertabelo.com)
* Keep your schema up-to-date with [Rails ERD](https://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd)


### Security

* Avoid common security problems following [Ruby on Rails Security Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html)
* Never store production data (logins, passwords etc) in source code repository
* Keep `config/database.yml` and `config/secrets.yml` outside of the source code repository. Use shell environment variables instead. More info [here](http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/managing-environment-configuration-variables-in-rails)
