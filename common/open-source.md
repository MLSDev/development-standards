# Open Source

Among else, we consider GitHub as a:
 * sales & marketing channel _(clients review our code; they see how we work)_
 * talent aquisition channel _(we look at applicants' code; they look at our code; they see how we work)_

## Our Open Source Contribution Strategy

* Extract the most useful, well-turned and successful common tasks solutions (for company and community) into open source projects under the company GitHub Ogranization profile.
* Of course, do not publish Intellectual Propety of our clients. Just public domain stuff.
* Give a higher priority to these frequently appearing tasks:
  * Registration & Login
  * Chats
  * Pagination / Endless Scroll
  * Push Notifications
  * Error Handling
  * Payments
  * SMS
  * Maps, Geolocation
  * Analytics
  * Validations
  * Simple and full-text search
  * Authentication / Authorization, JSON Web Tokens
  * I18n
  * L10n
* Do not hesitate to use third-party open source projects, _if they benefit us, our projects and our clients and save our time (but [check the license][licenses] first)._
* Invest our time to fork and make pull-requests to third-party open source projects, _if that benefits us, our projects and our clients and saves our time._
* Invest our time to support, maintain and update our open source projects (react to others developers' feedback, feature and pull requests, in particular)

## Project Releases

* Follow [MLSDev Version Numbering conventions][versioning]
* We are trying to present our projects to the community in the best possible way (see _Decoration_ section below)
* Publish under MIT License (see below)

## Decoration
